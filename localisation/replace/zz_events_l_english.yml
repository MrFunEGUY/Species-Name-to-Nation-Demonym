 precursor.311.desc:0 "Greetings from [artifact_seller.Capital.GetName]. There is a matter my government wishes to discuss.\n\nWe understand that your archeologists have been studying the ancient [Root.GetPrecursorCiv] civilization for quite some time. Understandable, since their territory once covered a large part of what today constitutes the [Root.GetName].\n\nAs it happens, their territory also extended into what is now the [artifact_seller.GetName], and [artifact_seller.GetAdj] archeologists have recovered a number of unique artifacts.

 diplomatic.15.desc:0 "The [Root.GetName] tries not to let spiritual concerns stand in the way of our exploration and examination of the mundane, but we know how to pay proper heed to metaphysical insights and traditions in the course of all actions. Scientists from [From.From.GetName] appear to be a bit more careless in their pursuit of new astronomic discoveries.\n\nAfter taking an interest in some of the nearby stars that form constellations crucial to [Root.GetAdj] mythology, [encroaching_research_leader.GetName] has been accused of trying to "disprove" some of the legends surrounding them. While we are confident that the spiritual significance of the constellations can hardly be touched by worldly discoveries, many have objected to the research and tried to persuade [encroaching_research_leader.GetHimHer] to leave [Root.GetAdj] space."
