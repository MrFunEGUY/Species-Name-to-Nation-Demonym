They claim to remember nothing of their time outside our dimension, aside from a vague awareness of having been away for some time.\n\nThey wish for nothing but to return to service under Science Officer [Root.GetLeaderName], and intend to surrender their ship to [Root.Owner.GetAdj] authorities."

It seems this alien race used lasers similar to the ones currently in use by [Root.Owner.GetAdj] fleets, and the fizzling innards periodically discharge low-powered beams into the ice of [From.GetName]. The planet's harsh climate prevents the lasers from actually melting the ice, allowing the chilly matrix to act as a brilliant prism."

 story.110.desc.phobe:0 "The Space Amoebas - now a quasi-derogatory term gleefully popularized by the [Root.GetAdj] forces tasked with bringing them down - are much more complex than anticipated. Their hardy exteriors protect a great number of pockets housing smaller "amoebas," creatures that our fleets have observed effectively acting as strike craft when engaging the "mothership amoeba." While superficially similar beyond the obvious differences in size, the "strike amoeba" are much simpler creatures than the Space Amoeba proper. Inside the Space Amoeba, beyond these pockets, lie hundreds of delicate organs doubtlessly all integral to surviving the harsh vacuum of space.\n\nMany of these organs ruptured or were simply incinerated in the process of dispatching the Amoeba, leaving us with a largely incomplete carcass.\n\nHowever, xeno-biologists assigned to the Space Amoeba project believe that the process of acquiring specimens is sound, and have distributed specific targeting instructions among the military fleets involved. With five more Amoebas, killed by surgical strikes to specific parts of their anatomy, a complete carcass can effectively be reconstructed."

 story.115.desc.phobe:0 "Several dead Amoebas later, we are able to investigate the Space Amoebas' grotesque relationship with the smaller creatures they house inside their bodies. As far as [Root.GetAdj] xeno-biologists can tell, these flagella - named for their whip-like movements - are not proper offspring or even parasites. They are simply spawned from the host once the host reaches maturity, created as tools rather than the result of procreation. Once their task is complete they return to a pocket in the host Amoeba, seemingly to receive new orders. They work as manipulators, blind appendages reaching in the dark. The laughably obvious drawbacks resulting from their inherently delayed reaction time are somewhat offset by the Amoeba's sheer number of circulating flagella, and the individual flagellum's strong set of reflexive responses and ability to dumbly track the host Amoeba.\n\nAt any rate, we are better at killing them now."

They are simply spawned from the host once the host reaches maturity, created as tools rather than the result of procreation. Where one would expect to find a brain - considering their intricate movement and inter-flagellar interactions - the flagellum instead possess a complex glandular processing center. This center decodes input - orders - in the form of RNA, secreted by the Amoeba and received by the flagellum through subcutaneous receptors. Once their task is complete they return to a pocket in the host Amoeba to receive new orders. This allows them to work as manipulators, hands severed from the body. The obvious drawbacks in this inherently delayed reaction time are somewhat offset by the Amoeba's sheer number of circulating flagella, and the individual flagellum's strong set of reflexive responses and ability to dumbly track the host Amoeba. The Space Amoebas' relative proficiency in deep-space combat is largely due to the consistent deployment of their flagella, something our forces could likely learn a lot from."

 story.115.desc:0 "Following the slaying of the fourth creature, a complete Space Amoeba carcass was reconstructed on the [Root.GetName]'s capital of [Root.Capital.GetName]. We are now beginning to divine some of the creatures' hidden truths, and they are being conveyed to the appropriate departments within [Root.GetAdj] administration.\n\nThe perhaps most useful discovery at present relates to the Space Amoebas' cutaneous membranes. They absorb and - through complex glandular processes - metabolize a wide range of cosmic radiation, seemingly drawing some sustenance from the rays."

The [Root.Owner.GetName] ought to take a step back, and observe from a respectful distance."

 story.205.desc.phile:0 "The Crystalline Entities - the name itself a compromise between rival factions of xeno-biologists and xeno-geologists on [Root.Capital.GetName] - are most definitely alive.\n\nSome overly-conservative members of the [Root.GetAdj] academic elite argue that they are "silicate-animate matter," and that they have little in common with biological life.\n\nThe vast majority of the [Root.GetName]'s populace reject that regressive perspective, instead turning their eyes toward the fascinating new horizons that the Crystalline Entities represent. They are, somewhat regrettably, solitary beings, each individual Crystal Sovereign rarely seen with more than one Sentinel and a smaller Cohort entity. Aside from the Cohort and Sentinel clearly being subservient to the Sovereign of the group, the subtle nuances of the Crystalline Entities' socio-hierarchical relationships are lost on us - which does not stop these dynamics from being the subject of fevered study on [Root.Capital.GetName].\n\nThe Entities do not seem to mate, and we have yet to observe any Crystals that are recognizably older or younger than others. Contrary to an early hypothesis, the shifts in hue between individual Crystalline Entities seem to be related not to their age but to their latent internal charge - which can be violently unleashed - and it appear as if though sporadic fluctuations in this charge alter the refractive properties of the Crystal."

 story.210.desc.milit:0 "The Crystalline Entities - a new designation better reflecting their apparent status as silicate yet animate matter - are tough and aggressive adversaries.\n\nOur engagements have allowed us to pinpoint structural weaknesses that should, theoretically, be shared among all individual Crystalline Entities. This is fortunate, as our fleets will need to engage with several more specimens if we are to learn anything about these enigmatic prisms. What we do know is that changes, in levels of apparent aggression and the internal generation of power that drives their weapon-like discharge, are accompanied by shifts in how the crystals break light.\n\nIn essence, it is likely that [Root.GetAdj] ships will eventually encounter Crystalline Entities in different colors, and should be prepared for differences in behavior and combat capabilities."

They would have been stars once, but were not.\n\nExplaining their apparent animal intelligence is more difficult, but the answer might lie in the abnormally strong electromagnetic fields that keep them together - another product of their primordial beginnings. It is not inconceivable that, given enough time, the circulation of its strange stardust and gravitic fields aligned in a flexible approximation of neural pathways.\n\nMoreover, the Clouds seem to be receiving impulses from one another, if not outright communicating, lightyears apart. Quantum entanglement is suspected to play a role in this phenomenon."

 story.501.desc:1 "The spaceborne lifeforms - which the [Root.GetAdj] Head of Society Research has come to refer to as "§YTiyanki§!" - are docile creatures.
