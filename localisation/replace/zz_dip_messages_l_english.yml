 01_ASK_BECOME_SATELLITE_SELECT:0 "Have you finally realized that knowledge is safer when the [Root.GetAdj] keeps it safe and secret?"

 05_HOSTILE_GREETING:0 "Why won't you just leave us alone, [From.GetAdj]?"

 11_HOSTILE_GREETING:0 "Your nation is both flawed and primitive, [From.GetAdj]. It pains me to witness such inefficiency."

 14_NEUTRAL_GREETING:0 "We are deeply concerned about the lack of freedom among your citizens, [From.GetAdj]."

 DH_VASSAL_GREETING_DISLOYAL_01:0 "This pretense of you being the masters of the [Root.GetAdj] is starting to become ridiculous. Your exotic curiosities were more pleasant when we could just import a few of you and not have to listen to your drivel."

 KK_VASSAL_GREETING_01:0 "Do not let your subjugation of [Root.GetName] make you arrogant, [From.GetAdj]. We all pay the price for overconfidence."
