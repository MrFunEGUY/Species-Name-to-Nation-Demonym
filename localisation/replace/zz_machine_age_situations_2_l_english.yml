 synth.1515.desc.neutral: "The §Y[root.GetAdj]§! population remains undecided on what form our digitized consciousness should take. More conservative voices would have us remain deeply rooted in corporeal bodies, while others resent this "half measure" between old and new.\n\nIt falls upon us to make that choice. The physical focus would allow a single worker to control multiple bodies, while a virtual existence would enable societal control on an unprecedented scale."

 synth.1520.desc.virtual: "§Y[From.GetAdj]§! people are willing to go even further, and favor a fully virtual existence over the half-measures of the physical world. This momentous event will create shockwaves that echo far into our future. By boosting the identity transfer speed and range, we are able to deploy rapid replacements for destroyed synthetic bodies during hazardous missions.\n\nThese new developments are sure to increase our efficiency in various war-related situations, and bring glory to the §Y[From.GetAdj]§! empire!"

 synth.1520.desc.neutral: "The §Y[From.GetAdj]§! empire is at a crossroads. Some believe bespoke physical bodies would bring us security and familiarity, while others argue against taking full advantage of the synthesization and everything it can bring.\n\nFocusing on the physical aspects would enable us to repurpose the knowledge of recently destroyed dignitaries for our research efforts. Alternatively, the path to virtual existence would allow mass-replacement of destroyed synthetic bodies via rapid identity transfer."
