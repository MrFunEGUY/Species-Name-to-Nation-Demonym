 first_contact_critters.15.desc:1 "The spaceborne lifeforms - which the [Owner.GetAdj] Head of Society Research has come to refer to as "§HTiyanki§!" - are docile creatures. Capable of accessing some lower dimension of subspace, they roam from system to system with remarkable ease.\n\nThey graze on gases common to the upper layers of many gas giants. It is highly unlikely, to say the least, that this is their only food source, but intake of other nutrients has yet to be observed.\n\nThey will rarely, if ever, attack, even when provoked. They can safely be ignored."

 first_contact_critters.25.desc:1 "The entities encountered by our fleets some time ago are new, spaceborne lifeforms.\n\nQuickly nicknamed §H"Space Amoeba"§! following a gross misreading of initial sensor output, the creature is in fact larger than the average [Owner.GetAdj] corvette."

 first_contact_critters.45.desc:0 "Reports of the deep-space drones previously encountered have been investigated closer. The drones appear to be the workers and custodians of an autonomous orbital mining operation, established millennia ago and then soon abandoned by all but the drones themselves, judging by the state of the processing equipment.\n\nThe drones possess powerful mining lasers and make obviously threatening, if not outright hostile, overtures toward [Owner.GetAdj] vessels when approached. They may only be old drones, but they should be kept under close watch by the [Owner.GetName]."
